abstract = {The complexity of the human brain has made it difficult to study many brain disorders in model organisms, highlighting the need for an in vitro model of human brain development. Here we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system, termed cerebral organoids, that develop various discrete, although interdependent, brain regions. These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype. Together, these data show that three-dimensional organoids can recapitulate development and disease even in this most complex human tissue.},

@article{Sun2004,
abstract = {This chapter attempts to give an overview of the historical development and current progress of femtosecond laser micro-nanofabrication based on multiphoton absorption, and particular emphasis is placed on two-photon photopolymerization. Femtosecond laser interaction with matter differs essentially from those with longer pulses or CW lasers in its significant nonlinearity, ultrafast characteristics and the possibility of highly localization of reaction volume. These features enable three-dimensional (3D) micronanofabrication in solid and liquid media. In two-photon photopolymerization, when a near-infrared femtosecond laser is tightly focused into a photopolymerizable resin, 3D polymer micro-nanostructures are produced by pinpoint photopolymerization of liquid precursory resins. Using this direct laser writing scheme, various photonic, micro-optical components and micromechanical devices have been readily produced. The two-photon photopolymerization technology is expected to play a similar role to that played by lithography for planar semiconductor device processing, but for micro-nanofabrication of 3D polymer-based optoelectronic devices as well for microelectromechanical systems.},

abstract = {Combined measurement of diverse molecular and anatomical traits that span multiple levels remains a major challenge in biology. Here, we introduce a simple method that enables proteomic imaging for scalable, integrated, high-dimensional phenotyping of both animal tissues and human clinical samples. This method, termed SWITCH, uniformly secures tissue architecture, native biomolecules, and antigenicity across an entire system by synchronizing the tissue preservation reaction. The heat- and chemical-resistant nature of the resulting framework permits multiple rounds ({\textgreater}20) of relabeling. We have performed 22 rounds of labeling of a single tissue with precise co-registration of multiple datasets. Furthermore, SWITCH synchronizes labeling reactions to improve probe penetration depth and uniformity of staining. With SWITCH, we performed combinatorial protein expression profiling of the human cortex and also interrogated the geometric structure of the fiber pathways in mouse brains. Such integrated high-dimensional information may accelerate our understanding of biological systems at multiple levels.},

abstract = {Classical experiments performed half a century ago demonstrated the immense self-organizing capacity of vertebrate cells. Even after complete dissociation, cells can reaggregate and reconstruct the original architecture of an organ. More recently, this outstanding feature was used to rebuild organ parts or even complete organs from tissue or embryonic stem cells. Such stem cell-derived three-dimensional cultures are called organoids. Because organoids can be grown from human stem cells and from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, they have the potential to model human development and disease. Furthermore, they have potential for drug testing and even future organ replacement strategies. Here, we summarize this rapidly evolving field and outline the potential of organoid technology for future biomedical research.},

@article{McMurtrey2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Cell monolayers have serious limitations for cell biological investigations and for cell-based assays in drug screening and toxicity studies. However, the establishment of three-dimensional cultures as a mainstream approach requires the development of reliable protocols, new cell lines and suitable imaging techniques. Moving from cell monolayers to three-dimensional (3D) cultures is motivated by the need to work with cellular models that mimic the functions of living tissues. Essential cellular functions that are present in tissues are missed by 'petri dish'-based cell cultures. This limits their potential to predict the cellular responses of real organisms. However, establishing 3D cultures as a mainstream approach requires the development of standard protocols, new cell lines and quantitative analysis methods, which include well-suited three-dimensional imaging techniques. We believe that 3D cultures will have a strong impact on drug screening and will also decrease the use of laboratory animals, for example, in the context of toxicity assays.},
