![SWITCH Antibody Compatibility, Related to Figure \ref{SWITCH-1}. A total of 90 antibodies were tested on SWITCH-processed sections and PFA-fixed control tissues, and a subset of these were also tested on CLARITY-processed sections. A summary of the results are displayed in Venn diagram form, and representative images from staining of SWITCH-processed samples using antibodies specific for various types of targets are shown. All images were obtained with either a 10x, 0.3 NA water-immersion objective or 40x, 1.25 NA oilimmersion objective. Scale bars, 20 µm. \label{SWITCH-Sup1}](source/figures/SWITCH/supfigure1.jpg){ width=100% }

![Multi-color Imaging of SWITCH-Processed Samples, Related to Figure \ref{SWITCH-2}. A 100-µm section of mouse tissue was processed using SWITCH and stained with DAPI, lectin, anti-GFAP, anti-MBP, and anti-CR. Representative images are shown with the fluorophores used for labeling. Leica TCS SP8 equipped with a white-light laser and spectral detection system was used for imaging. 25x, 0.95 NA, water-immersion objective. Scale bar, 50 µm. \label{SWITCH-Sup2}](source/figures/SWITCH/supfigure2.jpg){ width=100% }

![Autocorrelation Analysis of Myelinated Fibers, Related to Figure \ref{SWITCH-5}. Autocorrelation shows all the fiber orientations in a more non-biased manner. Autocorrelation was calculated using MATLAB by applying the Fourier convolution theorem with 3D FFT and a periodic boundary condition. (A) Subvolume used for the analysis of the fiber orientations. (B) Autocorrelation isosurfaces show orientation Fi angle. The autocorrelation result mirrors the finite difference gradient approach in that it showed a cubic grid pattern for the fibers. \label{SWITCH-Sup3}](source/figures/SWITCH/supfigure3.jpg){ width=100% }

![Autocorrelation Analysis of Bulk Myelinated Fibers, Related to Figure \ref{SWITCH-5}. (A) Subvolume used for the analysis of the fascicle orientations. (B–I) Same as that of the fiber analysis (Figure \ref{SWITCH-Sup3}) but for fascicles. This autocorrelation result also agrees with the finite difference gradient approach in that it showed an orthogonal divergence of the fascicles. AU, arbitrary unit. \label{SWITCH-Sup4}](source/figures/SWITCH/supfigure4.jpg){ width=100% }

![GA-Induced Fluorescence, Related to Figure \ref{SWITCH-1}. Aldehyde fixatives can react with tissue components to generate fluorescent products. (A and B) Background fluorescence is worse in GA than PFA and is especially pronounced in the green (488) to yellow (561) regions. Sodium borohydride (SB) treatment can reduce these fluorescent products. N = 3. Scale bar, 100 µm. (C) SB treatment results in tissue damage and bubble formation within the sample. Grid spacing, 1 mm. \label{SWITCH-Sup5}](source/figures/SWITCH/supfigure5.jpg){ width=90% }

![mRNA FISH on Thermally Cleared Samples, Related to Figure \ref{SWITCH-4}. SWITCH-processed samples were cleared at 37C and 70C before being subjected to an mRNA FISH protocol to label c-fos (red). Nuclei are stained with Hoechst (gray). Samples cleared at 37C showed successful mRNA labeling, but samples cleared at 70C contained no detectable mRNA. Scale bar, 100 µm. \label{SWITCH-Sup6}](source/figures/SWITCH/supfigure6.jpg){ width=100% }

Table: Statistics of All Combinations of Six Cell Markers, Related to Figure \ref{SWITCH-3}.

### Supplemental Experimental Procedures {.unnumbered}

#### Mice {.unnumbered}

Young adult male and female C57BL/6 and Thy1-eGFP-M mice were housed in a
reverse 12-hr light/dark cycle with unrestricted access to food and water. All
experimental protocols were approved by the MIT Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee and Division of Comparative Medicine and were in accordance with
guidelines from the National Institute of Health.

#### Perfusion {.unnumbered}

Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS and a solution consisting of
4% PFA and 1– 4% GA in PBS. Brain tissues were harvested and incubated in the
same fixative solution at 4°C for 2–3 days and 2–7 hr at 37°C with gentle
shaking to allow for uniform fixation throughout the sample. This incubation
time is critical for mitigating the effects of variable perfusion quality and
promotes uniform structural and molecular preservation of the sample throughout
the SWITCH process, as samples that are not ideally preserved will experience
greater loss of biomolecules and a greater degree of sample deformation.

#### SWITCH-mediated Tissue Preservation {.unnumbered}

PFA-fixed human samples were washed in a solution consisting of 50% PBS titrated
to pH 3 using HCl, 25% 0.1 M HCl, and 25% 0.1 M potassium hydrogen phthalate
(KHP). This wash solution was then replaced with fresh solution with the
addition of 4–10% GA. The samples were then incubated in this pH 3 solution at
4°C for 2 days with gentle shaking. The acidic pH of this solution greatly slows
down the reaction speed of aldehyde fixatives. The solution was then replaced
with PBS with the addition of 1–4% GA and the sample was again allowed to
incubate for 2–3 days at 4°C and 2–7 hr at 37°C with gentle shaking. The sample
was then washed in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 1 day with gentle shaking.
After washing, reactive GA within the sample was inactivated by incubation in a
solution consisting of 4% glycine and 4% acetamide for 1 day at 37°C with gentle
shaking. Finally, the sample was washed for 1 day in PBS at RT with gentle
shaking.

#### GA Gelation Time Experiment {.unnumbered}

All reagents and containers were first cooled to 4°C and handled on ice. For pH
7 gels, 10 mL of a PBS solution containing 10% BSA was made prior to GA
injection. For pH 3, 10 mL of a 0.1 M KHP buffer was titrated to pH 3 with HCl.
Once the pH 3 and 7 BSA solutions were prepared, GA was added to a final
concentration of 4% and a timer was started. Gelation was judged by inverting
the tube and inspecting for fluid flow. The time required to form rigid gels was
recorded in 3 replicates of the pH 3 and 7 condition.


#### Gel Denaturation Experiment {.unnumbered}

For acrylamide (AA) gels, 10 mL of a 4% PFA, 5–15% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
4% AA, and 0.25% VA-044 solution was prepared in PBS. The polymerization was
carried out under vacuum for 2 hr at 37°C in a 15 mL tube. For GA gels, 10 mL of
a 5–15% BSA and 1% GA solution was prepared in PBS and allowed to gel at room
temperature for 2 hr in a 15 mL tube. For the epoxide gels, 10 mL of a 5–15% BSA
and 15% epoxide (i.e., EX-313, GE31, GE22) solution was prepared in 0.1 M
carbonate buffer at pH 9 and allowed to gel at 37°C for 8 hr in a 15 mL tube.
Each gel was extracted from the tubes and cut into approximately 5-mm-thick
disks. The disks were then washed overnight in PBST to remove any unreacted
reagents. After washing, each disk was massed and photographed. The disks were
then transferred to an 80°C water bath and incubated overnight. The disks were
removed, massed, and photographed again.

#### Sodium Borohydride Treatment {.unnumbered}

Sodium borohydride (SB) buffer was made immediately before use by making a 1
mg/ml SB solution with PBS. For 100-μm sections, the tissue was treated 3 times,
10 minutes each. For whole brain, the tissue was treated 3 times, 3 hr each. For
both, incubation was done at room temperature without shaking.

#### Passive Clearing with Thermal Energy {.unnumbered}

Aqueous clearing solution containing 200 mM SDS, 10 mM lithium hydroxide, 40 mM
boric acid, and a variable amount of anti-browning agent (i.e., 0–50 mM sodium
sulfite or 0–0.5% (w/v) 1- thioglycerol) was titrated to pH 9 using sodium
hydroxide before use. For high temperature clearing, samples were incubated in
40 mL of clearing solution for 8 hr at RT with gentle shaking to allow for the
anti-browning agent to diffuse throughout the tissue. Samples were then
transferred to a water bath set at 60–80°C. The clearing buffer was replaced if
any noticeable color was observed in solution at any point during clearing. To
remove the remaining antibrowning agent and SDS after clearing, the samples were
washed at 37°C for 24 hr in 40 mL PBST containing 0.02% sodium azide as a
preservative.

#### mRNA FISH {.unnumbered}

Mice were perfused with ice-cold PBS and then with fixative (4% PFA and 1% GA in
PBS). Brains were incubated in the fixative for one day at 4˚C and then 6 hr at
RT for post-fixation. Coronal sections were prepared with a vibratome and
sections were inactivated at RT for 6 hr, followed by tissue clearing under 37˚C
or 70˚C. All solutions were prepared by using diethylpyrocarbonate
(DEPC)-treated water. Digoxigenin- and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP)-labeled fos cRNA
probes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. FISH
signals were visualized using a tyramide amplification kit (Perkin Elmer).

#### Refractive Index Matching {.unnumbered}

A customized refractive index (RI)-matching solution was made by dissolving 50 g
diatrizoic acid, 40 g n-methyl-d-glucamine, and 55 g iodixanol per 100 mL water.
Cleared samples were incubated in 10 mL of this solution at RT with gentle
shaking for 2 days prior to imaging, replacing the solution after the first day.
The listed components and their proportions were chosen to adjust the pH and RI
for ideal optical clearing (basic pH with RI near 1.47) as well as optimize the
osmolarity of the solution to reverse the sample expansion observed after
clearing. The contrast agents, diatrizoic acid and iodixanol, significantly
affect the RI of the solution, while n-methyl-dglucamine is used to adjust the
pH to more basic values. All components were considered when optimizing for
osmolarity. RI was measured using an Abbemat WR/MW automatic multiwavelength
refractometer.

#### Mounting and Imaging {.unnumbered}

To facilitate the use of long working distance immersion objectives, samples
were mounted between a slide glass and a glass-bottom Willco dish. Blu-Tack
adhesive was rolled into a cylindrical shape of a thickness slightly greater
than that of the sample and was placed in a circular orientation on the slide
glass with a small opening to allow addition of immersion medium after chamber
construction. The sample was placed within the Blu-Tack circle and the Willco
dish was secured onto the adhesive, pressing just firmly enough to make slight
contact with the sample. This contact prevents the sample from moving during the
imaging process, but minimizes sample deformation. For multiplexed staining
experiments, contact was not made with the sample. Taking care to avoid
introduction of bubbles, RI-matching solution was injected to fill the void
space, and the opening was then closed using fast-curing epoxy glue. Three
microscope systems were used for the experiments in this study:

i. Olympus two-photon microscope system (FV1200MPE) equipped with a 25×
CLARITYoptimized objective (prototype; NA, 1.0; WD, 8.0 mm), a 10×
CLARITY-optimized objective (XLPLN10XSVMP; NA, 0.6; WD, 8.0 mm), a 10×
water-immersion objective (NA, 0.30; WD, 3.6 mm), and a 40× oil-immersion
objective (UPLSAPO40XS; NA, 1.25; WD, 0.3 mm). 405, 488, and 635 nm 1p lasers
were used;

ii. Leica TCS SP8 microscope system equipped with a white-light laser, spectral
detection system, a 20× water-immersion objective (NA, 0.50; WD, 3.5 mm) and a
25× waterimmersion objective (NA, 0.95; WD, 2.4 mm).

iii. Custom-made light-sheet microscope equipped with 10× CLARITY-optimized
objective (modified from Tomer et al., 2012). Sample datasets were visualized
with IMARIS (Bitplane).

#### Sample Delabeling {.unnumbered}

Imaged samples were delabeled in clearing solution at 60–80°C (elution
condition) for 1–2 days for large samples and overnight (O/N) for thin samples.
Sulfites were added for large samples to prevent browning during the extended
delabeling process.

#### Protein Loss Assay {.unnumbered}

Mouse brain samples were prepared using various preservation methods,
hemisected, and then cut into 1-mm sections. The collection of sections from
each hemisphere was massed and then placed into 5 mL of 200 mM SDS clearing
solution. The samples were incubated at 37°C with gentle shaking for 2 weeks. A
small aliquot was taken from each tube and analyzed using the Bio-Rad DC protein
assay kit to quantify the degree of protein loss from the samples.

#### Microstructure Preservation Assay {.unnumbered}

A Thy1-eGFP-M mouse was perfused with SWITCH fixative solution and the sample
was cut into 1-mm sections. The eGFP expression on the surface of a section was
imaged using confocal microscopy and then sample was then subjected to clearing
under harsh conditions (200 mM SDS, 80°C) for 1 day. The sample was then labeled
using anti-eGFP antibodies and the same region was imaged again using confocal
microscopy.

#### Macrostructure Preservation Assay {.unnumbered}

Samples processed using SWITCH and CLARITY were cut in 1-mm sections and
subjected to clearing under harsh conditions for 1 day. The samples were then
mounted in a chamber larger than the size of the sample to prevent compression
and imaged using confocal microscopy. RI-matching solution was used to
facilitate imaging of the sample. Cross-sections from the samples were
visualized using IMARIS.

#### Human Tissue Samples {.unnumbered}

Samples of fixed autopsy tissue were obtained from the Neuropathology Core of
the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center. Tissue was collected and
banked in accordance with approval from the local Institutional Review Board.
All samples studied came from subjects without evidence of neurologic disease on
clinical grounds at the time of death and without evidence of significant
disease processes upon full neuropathologic examination.

#### Multiplexed Labeling of Thin Samples {.unnumbered}

A human clinical sample containing visual cortex was obtained and processed
using SWITCH. After fixation, 100-μm sections were obtained from the sample and
cleared under harsh conditions. In each round, the sample was labeled with DAPI,
DyLight 488-conjugated lectin, and a variable antibody using standard
immunolabeling procedures. The sample was mounted in a chamber larger than the
size of the sample, imaged using confocal microscopy, and then delabeled under
harsh conditions O/N. RI-matching solution was used to facilitate imaging of the
sample.

#### Co-Registration of Multiplexed SWITCH Experiments {.unnumbered}

To register the set of SWITCH experiments from a single tissue, one of the
experimental rounds for a tissue is arbitrarily chosen as the fixed reference to
which the rest of the experiments will be registered. Each experiment has one
fluorescence channel dedicated to lectin, which allows the software to identify
distinctive points in the vasculature in order to achieve the fine morphological
adjustments across the tissue volume. We used a 3D Harris Corner detector
(Harris and Stephens, 1988) to find those keypoints and a 3D modification of the
SIFT descriptor (Lowe, 2004; Scovanner et al., 2007) to calculate
correspondences. For robustness, we instituted a variation of RANSAC (Fischler
and Bolles, 1981) to test affine transformations on local subvolumes, confirming
that keypoint correspondences between experiments were legitimate. Finally, with
the validated keypoints, a thin plate spline interpolation (Bookstein, 1989) was
implemented to warp the tissue in a physically plausible manner.

Each experiment was processed individually by eye before using software to
calculate the registration: The size of the interrogated tissues, approximately
1 mm3 in volume with 1.09 μm × 1.09 μm × 1.99 μm resolution, required imaging
subvolumes that were stitched together using the Leica or Olympus microscope
software. The resulting tissue volume, a 4-dimensional object for the three
spatial coordinates and the fluorescence channel, was examined by human eye
using FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012) to ensure image quality and a common
orientation across experiments. Additionally, a rectangular crop was made around
the tissue to remove unnecessary, blank voxels. Each individual experiment was
then processed using a MATLAB computational pipeline developed for SWITCH and
shared online via Github (https://github.com/dgoodwin208/Registration).

The registration pipeline has five primary steps based on the Lectin channel of
each experiment. First, the image volume is partitioned into 25 subvolumes for
parallelization of work and robustness checking in later steps. Each subvolume
then identifies distinguishable keypoints using a 3D Harris Corner Detector and
uses a 3D modification of SIFT written by Scovanner
(http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~pscovann/) to create a descriptor vector associated with
the keypoint. Note that we calculated keypoints and descriptors at multiple
scale levels, achieved by convolution with Gaussian kernels of progressive size,
to ensure a sufficient degree of scale invariance to the detected descriptors to
successfully find matches despite differences in microscope setups across
experiments. The calculations for keypoints and descriptors was often calculated
in parallel across subvolumes to save time.

The third step is that each subvolume searches for corresponding keypoints in
the appropriate subvolume in the reference experiment using the SIFT metric for
measuring similarity between descriptors. To accomplish this we used the
open-source VLFeat (http://www.vlfeat.org) implementation of SIFT matching
algorithm. The fourth step is that the keypoint correspondences are validated
via calculating affine transformations of random subsets of 4 corresponding
keypoints, and the number of inliers of the resulting transformation assessed by
a voxel distance threshold of 3 pixels. Each time a pair of corresponding points
is counted as an inlier, it receives a vote, and after the order of 106 affine
transformations, correspondence pairs with at least 80% of the votes of the
highest voted pair are kept as legitimate correspondences. Finally, the
validated correspondences are used to calculate a thin plate spline for the
entire volume using an opensource TPS implementation written by Yang, Foong and
Ong
(http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47409-glmdtps-registrationmethod/
content/GLMD_Demo/src/TPS3D.m), resulting in a highly accurate warp to match the
morphology of the reference experiment.

#### Semi-automatic Identification of Cells and Blood Vessels {.unnumbered}

Image volumes were displayed and analyzed using custom-built graphical user
interface software developed with Delphi XE4 (Embarcadero Technologies). Each
image section was preprocessed to correct the inhomogeneous illumination at each
image tile. In detail, we subtracted the mean intensity of a 100 × 100 μm2
window centered to each pixel from its intensity to uniformize the background
intensity. A different algorithm was devised specifically for each marker to
semiautomatically detect the centroid location and soma size of all cellular
objects and vascular pixels. In general, a spherical soma volume was isolated
according to the best contrast between intrasomal pixels and background pixels
by increasing the size of concentric spheres, and the soma size was determined
as the spherical diameter. After this automatic detection process, we corrected
misidentified cell bodies manually, and the portion of the correction was less
than 10%. We applied normalization of foreground signal and a Gaussian filter to
the NeuN channel prior to the analysis. SMI-32+ cells were fully recognized
manually according to their characteristic feature of the soma connected to a
vertically oriented fiber with a large nuclear shadow, and the determination of
their coordinates and soma sizes was aided by an automation module of the
software. Each section in the lectin channel was converted to a vascular pixel
mask image according to a customized threshold, and unconnected small clusters
of pixels were removed.

#### Quantitative Analysis of the Co-registered Image Channels {.unnumbered}

We used a series of custom-built software developed with Delphi XE4 for the
quantitative analysis. For co-expression analysis of two or more markers, an
initial decision was made by checking whether the centroids of cells in each
channel fell within a 5-μm distance. This classification was then manually
verified with a quick review software tool. Especially, NeuN− neurons were
carefully reviewed, and any weak NeuN signal that changed synchronously with the
other marker signal was identified as NeuN+. Cell density, vascular density, and
cell- or pixel-to-vessel distance along cortical depth were obtained from their
average of 50- or 100-μm window with a 50- or 100-μm interval, and data points
of less than 10 objects were excluded from plotting. Cell and vascular densities
were corrected to exclude the dead volume outside the tissue in the ROI. The
cell-tovessel distance was calculated as a distance from the centroid location
of the cell to the nearest vascular pixel. Cells or pixels positioned at the
sections containing any incomplete vascular information (z ≤ 24 μm or z ≥ 80 μm)
were excluded from the analysis of distance to nearest vessel. The distribution
profile of cell-to-vessel distance was obtained with a 3-μm interval.

#### SWITCH-mediated Myelinated Fiber Labeling {.unnumbered}

To create a DiD solution for myelinated fiber labeling, 1 mg of DiD powder was
dissolved in 200 μL of a solution consisting of 10 mM SDS in PBS (SWITCH-Off).
For 1-mm mouse sections, samples were incubated in SWITCH-Off solution O/N with
gentle shaking at 37°C. The solution was replaced with a volume of fresh
SWITCH-Off buffer that was sufficient to cover the sample, and 1 μL of the DiD
solution was added. The sample was allowed to incubate for 1 day at 37°C with
gentle shaking, at which point the sample was moved to a large volume of PBST
(SWITCHOn) for 1 day at 37°C with gentle shaking. The sample was imaged using
confocal microscopy. RI-matching solution was used to facilitate imaging of the
sample. For mouse hemispheres, the sample was incubated in SWITCH-Off solution
at 37°C O/N with gentle shaking and then transferred to a volume of fresh
SWITCH-Off solution sufficient to cover the sample, at which point 2 μL of the
DiD solution was added. The sample was incubated in this solution at 37°C for 4
days with gentle shaking and then moved to a large volume of SWITCH-On solution
for 1 day at 37°C with gentle shaking. RI-matching solution was used to
facilitate imaging of the sample.

#### Orientation Analysis of Myelinated Fibers {.unnumbered}

Analysis was performed on planar images in the xy, yz, and xz planes using
OrientationJ (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/demo/orientation/). Specifically,
OrientationJ was used to calculate the preferred orientation of each pixel
(ranging from −90° to 90°) using the corresponding finite difference gradient.
This generates planar images whose pixel values correspond to the angular
component in that plane (i.e., xy planar image contains θxy). After obtaining
this orientational information in xy, yz, and xz for all slices, the separate
components of the orientation (i.e., θxy contains x and y components of the
orientation) are added together to yield three-dimensional orientation vectors.
The orientation vectors represent the orientations of the fibers and the
fascicles. These orientation vectors can be binned according to their angles to
yield information about how the fibers and the fascicles are distributed in
terms of their orientation. This information can then be used to predict what
angle of intersection these fibers make. Specifically, each peak in the
histogram is identified and the subpopulation is estimated based on the FWHM.
These are then assigned to either fibers or fascicles based on observation
(i.e., in the xy plane, the image shows that fibers make a vertical/horizontal
grid while the fascicles make more of a diagonal/diagonal diversion; this means
that the peaks near 0 and 90 (which is equivalent to −90) correspond to the
fibers, and the peaks near −45 and 45 correspond to the fascicles). After
obtaining the total populations of the entire volume, the intersections are
estimated by subtracting the corresponding two peaks and then scaling that
result by the FWHM. Then, assuming that all fibers and fascicles have similar
pixel counts, the fraction of fibers making certain intersections can be
determined.

#### Autocorrelation Analysis of Myelinated Fibers {.unnumbered}

The analysis using the finite difference gradient is a nonlinear process that
may introduce error to the analysis. The error is compounded by the fact that
the z-resolution of the volume is almost three times lower than the x- and
y-resolutions. A more accurate approach would be to use autocorrelation. (The
finite difference gradient acts as a high pass filter for the autocorrelation.)
Autocorrelation would show all the peak distributions in a more non-biased
manner. As such, we calculated the autocorrelation in the volume image using
MATLAB. Specifically, we used the Fourier convolution theorem with 3DFFT and a
periodic boundary condition to calculate the autocorrelation of the volume image
filtered with a Gaussian window; then, we transformed the resulting
autocorrelation data in Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates and
integrated out the radial component to visualize the data.

#### SWITCH-mediated Antibody Labeling {.unnumbered}

Samples were first equilibrated in a large volume of SWITCH-Off solution (0.5 mM
SDS in PBS). Samples were then moved to a volume a SWITCH-Off solution just
large enough to cover the sample and containing 20 μL of antibody solution (for
histone H3 staining of 1-mm-thick tissue blocks.) Care should be taken to ensure
that the final concentration of SDS in the SWITCH-Off solution is appropriate
after the addition of antibody solution. The amount of antibody solution
necessary will depend on the target identity. The samples were incubated in this
antibody solution for 12 hr at 37°C with gentle shaking. Samples were then
transferred to 10 mL of SWITCH-On solution (PBST) and were washed for 12 hr at
37°C with gentle shaking.

![Antibody signals in the presence of sodium deoxycholate (NaDC). Diverse antibody signals were acquired under the control buffer (PBS with 0.1% Triton-X100) and 0.1% or 1% NaDC in PBS. All images of each antibody were acquired under the same condition. \label{eFLASH-Sup1}](source/figures/eFLASH/supfigure1.jpg){ width=100% }

![Measurement of NaDC concentration and pH of eFLASH buffers. (a) A standard curve for determining the concentration of NaDC in eFLASH bufferscollected at various time points during the experiment. Details can be found in the methods section. N = 3 replicate measurements. (b-c) NaDC concentrations (b) and pH (c) measurement for the two buffers used for eFLASH experiments (main and sample buffers) at 3 hour intervals. N = 3 independent experiments. Mean ± s.e.m. \label{eFLASH-Sup2}](source/figures/eFLASH/supfigure2.jpg){ width=85% }

![Cell detection algorithm. (a) Schematic of the algorithm. (b) Image of mouse brain stained with PV. (c) The difference of Gaussians is computed and local maxima are detected in 3 dimensions (red dots). (d) 31x31 patches in the X/Y, X/Z and Y/Z planes, centered at each local maxima are collected and PCA is performed to reduce the image to 48 components. The first and second components measure brightness at two different diameter scales and the third and fourth components measure intensity anisotropy in the X and Y directions. (e) A random-forest classifier is trained using the components as features and each maximum position is classified as a true (green dot) or false (red dot) detection. \label{eFLASH-Sup3}](source/figures/eFLASH/supfigure3.jpg){ width=100% }

![Representative NPY+ neurons with different dendrite polarities. Projection images of NPY+ neurons (left) and their reconstruction (right) were presented. BT, bitufted cell; BD, bidirectional cell; MP3, multipolar cell with three principal dendrites; MP (>4), multipolar cell with four or more numbers of principal dendrites. Scale bar = 20 μm. \label{eFLASH-Sup4}](source/figures/eFLASH/supfigure4.jpg){ width=85% }

![Optimization of aldehyde fixation for organoids: (A) Methodology for quantifying mean fluorescence intensity for individual cells. ROI regions were generated in FIJI by (i) auto-threshold of images, (ii) analyze particles and watershed (iii) generate mask to analyze greyscale image.(B) Evaluation of organoid fixation on antibody staining using protocols widely used in the literature. Data shows that nuclear epitopes Sox2 and Histone H3 are sensitive to over-fixation and show dramatic signal decrease. We selected a fixation in PBS + 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature. \label{phenotyping-Sup1}](source/figures/Phenotyping/supfigure1.jpg){ width=100% }

![Optimization of SHIELD protocol for organoids: (A) Organoids fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Organoids were then incubated in a solution of polyepoxy compound polyglycerol-3-polyglycidyl ether (P3PE) in 0.1M phosphate buffer pH7 at 4°C. Samples were incubated in this solution for 48h to ensure tissue saturation with P3PE, then solution was removed and replaced with pre-warmed 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer (pH10) and incubated at 37°C to activate covalent bonds between epoxide groups and available amines in the tissue. Samples were then cleared in 0.2M SDS, 50 mM boric acid pH9.5 at 55°C for 48h. Samples were washed extensively and stained with anti-Sox2 (Millipore AB5603) and anti-Nestin (Millipore MAB5326). Data shows that below 2% SHIELD (poly-epoxide) samples disintegrated and became fragile. We selected 2% since it preserved samples and maintained anti-Sox2 signal. (B) Optimization of clearing solution shows that at low and high pH, antibody staining is reduced for Sox2 (CST #	5067S) and Tbr1 (CST #32518S), we also saw the appearance of non-specific Tbr1+ spots next to positive cells at high pH. We selected a 0.2M SDS solution at pH7 using 50 mM phosphate buffers. \label{phenotyping-Sup2}](source/figures/Phenotyping/supfigure2.jpg){ width=100% }

![Nuclei detection and segmentation accuracy: (A) Nuclei detection and semantic segmentation of a syto16 stained cerebral organoid. The nuclei seed points are used in a 3D watershed segmentation to partition the foreground mask among all the nuclei detected as peaks in the probability map. Scale bar, 100 µm (B) Illustration of a minimum cut on an undirected graph used for nuclei semantic segmentation. Log-likelihood penalties were constructed using a mixutre of Poisson distributions estimated from the image histogram. (C) Analytical definitions of the shape operator and logistic regression function used to calculate nuclei principal curvatures and probability maps, respectively. (D) 2D slices and nuclei segmentations for a syto16-stained cerebral organoid. Scale bar, 100 µm. (E) Nuclei detection accuracy assessed by matching with manually annotated nuclei centroids. Scale bar, 10 µm. (F) Tuning hyperparameters for gaussian filtering by maximizing F1 score. (G) Test set F1 scores from our technique compared to Laplacian (LoG) and Difference (DoG) of Gaussian blob detectors. \label{phenotyping-Sup3}](source/figures/Phenotyping/supfigure3.jpg){ width=100% }

![Ventricle segmentation: (A) Example workflow for semi-automatic active-countour segmentation of ventricles using ITK-Snap. A spherical seed volume is iteratively dilated within the masked region obtained from thresholding the SOX2 image. After dilation, the ventricle completely filled and the segmentation can be rendered in 3D. (B) Overlay of a 2D syto16 image with the associated ventricle segmentation from the ground-truth 3D segmentation. (C) Example ventricle probability map output from our U-Net model. These 2D probability maps contain floating point values between 0 and 1. (D) Test performance of ventricle segmention U-Net based on a 20% hold-out test set (1520 images). The Dice coefficient was computed for each test image resulting in an average of 97.2%. By sweeping the probability threshold used to convert the U-Net output probability maps into binary masks from 0 to 1, a the model precision and recall were calculated to construct the ROC curve. \label{phenotyping-Sup4}](source/figures/Phenotyping/supfigure4.jpg){ width=100% }
