The brain is the most complex human organ, containing components from the nanometer scale to the centimeter scale, such as synapses, neurons, and brain regions. However, many experimental techniques in imaging, analysis, and tissue culture have been optimized for smaller brain models. This thesis summarizes a body of work aimed at scaling up imaging, analysis, and tissue culture techniques for large-scale brain models. Fluorescence imaging of large-scale models is limited by diffusion of molecular probes and the resolution of long working distance objectives. We present a technique termed SWITCH that inhibits probe binding to allow for diffusion without the formation of a reaction front. To improve imaging resolution, we present a tissue expansion technique called MAP that physically magnifies tissue samples for super-resolution imaging. We demonstrate a 4-fold increase in effective resolution using long working distance objectives and show that the tissue distortion through expansion is comparable to the deformation that occurs during handling. Volumetric imaging of large-scale models generates petabyte scale data, for which we present horizontally scalable image processing pipelines for analysis of intact mouse brains and cerebral organoids. The mouse brain pipeline allows region-based statistical analysis of protein expression and cell counts. The cerebral organoid pipeline allows single-cell, cytoarchitectural, and morphological analyses to be combined into a hyperdimensional statistical analysis. We use this pipeline to show phenotypic changes during development. In order to overcome limitations in multicolor imaging, we also present a 3D image coregistration pipeline capable of aligning multiple rounds of staining of the same whole-brain sample at single-cell resolution. We show that the average distance between corresponding nuclei after coregistration is less than 4 um. Finally, large-scale tissue cultures are limited by nutrient transport since they lack a vascular system. To address this issue in vitro, we fabricated synthetic vasculature by two-photon photopolymerization of polyethylene glycol based resins. Printed micro-vessels were 100 um in outer diameter, durable yet flexible, and permeable to bio-molecules in a tunable manner. Perfusion of vascularized cerebral organoids cultured for 30 days resulted in the expected neuronal differentiation as well as integration of the vascular network. Future studies can use and build on these technical advances to further our understanding of the brain through the use of large-scale brain models.
