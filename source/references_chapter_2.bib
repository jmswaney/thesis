This process creates a tissue-hydrogel hybrid that is physically stable, that preserves fine structure, proteins and nucleic acids, and that is permeable to both visible-spectrum photons and exogenous macromolecules. Here we highlight relevant challenges and opportunities of this approach, especially with regard to integration with complementary methodologies for brain-mapping studies.},

abstract = {Nondestructive chemical processing of porous samples such as fixed biological tissues typically relies on molecular diffusion. Diffusion into a porous structure is a slow process that significantly delays completion of chemical processing. Here, we present a novel electrokinetic method termed stochastic electrotransport for rapid nondestructive processing of porous samples. This method uses a rotational electric field to selectively disperse highly electromobile molecules throughout a porous sample without displacing the low-electromobility molecules that constitute the sample. Using computational models, we show that stochastic electrotransport can rapidly disperse electromobile molecules in a porous medium. We apply this method to completely clear mouse organs within 1-3 days and to stain them with nuclear dyes, proteins, and antibodies within 1 day. Our results demonstrate the potential of stochastic electrotransport to process large and dense tissue samples that were previously infeasible in time when relying on diffusion.},

We describe a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method, iDISCO, that permits whole-mount immunolabeling with volume imaging of large cleared samples ranging from perinatal mouse embryos to adult organs, such as brains or kidneys. iDISCO is modeled on classical histology techniques, facilitating translation of section staining assays to intact tissues, as evidenced by compatibility with 28 antibodies to both endogenous antigens and transgenic reporters like GFP. When applied to degenerating neurons, iDISCO revealed unexpected variability in number of apoptotic neurons within individual sensory ganglia despite tight control of total number in all ganglia. It also permitted imaging of single degenerating axons in adult brain and the first visualization of cleaved Caspase-3 in degenerating embryonic sensory axons in vivo, even single axons. iDISCO enables facile volume imaging of immunolabeled structures in complex tissues.

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography-the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.},

In developing cerebral cortex, transcriptional differences are found between different proliferative and post-mitotic layers, wherein laminar signatures reflect cellular composition and developmental processes. Cytoarchitectural differences between human and mouse have molecular correlates, including species differences in gene expression in subplate, although surprisingly we find minimal differences between the inner and outer subventricular zones even though the outer zone is expanded in humans. Both germinal and post-mitotic cortical layers exhibit fronto-temporal gradients, with particular enrichment in the frontal lobe.

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse.

This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways.

We observed an increase in microglial response at earlier time points as compared to 4 weeks, a progressive astrocytic response, and fewer neurons at the vicinity of an implanted device. These results are similar to what has been described in literature using other rodent strains, previously attainable only through time-consuming and variable immunohistochemistry methods.

A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting.

abstract = {Neuropeptide Y-containing interneurons in the dentate hilar area play an important role in inhibiting the activity of hippocampal circuitry. Hilar cells are often among the first lost in hippocampal epilepsy. As many types of neurons are found in the hilus, we used a new transgenic mouse expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a subset of neurons that colocalized neuropeptide Y (NPY), somatostatin (SST), and GABA for whole-cell, perforated, and cell-attached recording in 240 neurons. As these neurons have not previously been identifiable in live slices, they have not been the focus of physiological analysis. Hilar NPY neurons showed modest spike frequency adaptation, a large 15.6 ± 1.0 mV afterhyperpolarization, a mean input resistance of 335 ± 26 m $\Omega$, and were capable of fast-firing. Muscimol-mediated excitatory actions were found in a nominally Ca 2+ -free/high-Mg 2+  bath solution using cell-attached recording. GABA A receptor antagonists inhibited half the recorded neurons and blocked burst firing. Gramicidin perforated-patch recording revealed a GABA reversal potential positive to both the resting membrane potential and spike threshold. Together, these data suggest GABA is excitatory to many NPY cells. NPY and SST consistently hyperpolarized and reduced spike frequency in these neurons. No hyperpolarization of NPY on membrane potential was detected in the presence of tetrodotoxin, AP5, CNQX and bicuculline, supporting an indirect effect. Under similar conditions, SST hyperpolarized the cells, suggesting a direct postsynaptic action. Depolarizing actions of GABA and GABA-dependent burst-firing may synchronize a rapid release of GABA, NPY, and SST, leading to pre- and postsynaptic inhibition of excitatory hippocampal circuits. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

abstract = {The neuropeptides somatostatin (SS), neuropeptide Y (NPY), the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and enzymatic activity for NADPH diaphorase (NADPHd) are extensively colocalized in striatal interneurons, which has led to the widespread tendency to operationally treat all four substances as being completely colocalized within a single class of striatal interneurons. We have explored the validity of this assumption in rat striatum using multiple-labeling methods. Conventional epi-illumination fluorescence microscopy was used to examine tissue triple labeled for SS, NPY and nNOS, or double-labeled for SS and nNOS or for SS and NPY. In tissue double-labeled for SS and nNOS, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of SS and nNOS labeling were compared to subsequent NADPHd labeling. We found that SS, NPY and nNOS co-occurred extensively, but a moderately abundant population of neurons containing SS and nNOS but not NPY was also observed, as were small populations of SS only and nNOS only neurons. About 80{\%} of SS + neurons contained NPY, and no NPY neurons were devoid of SS or nNOS. All neurons containing nNOS in rat striatum were found to contain NADPHd. Combining our various quantitative observations, we found that of those striatal neurons containing any combination of SS, NPY, nNOS and NADPHd in rats, about 73{\%} contained all four, 16{\%} contained SS, nNOS and NADPHd, 5{\%} contained SS only, and 6{\%} contained only nNOS and NADPHd. These results indicate that while there is a large population of striatal neurons in which SS, NPY, nNOS and NADPHd are colocalized in rats, there may be smaller populations of striatal neurons devoid of NPY in which SS or nNOS/NADPHd are found individually or together.},

abstract = {Neurons in the monkey and rat cerebral cortex immunoreactive for somatostatin tetradecapeptide (SRIF) and for neuropeptide Y (NPY) were examined in the light and electron microscope. Neurons immunoreactive for either peptide are found in all areas of monkey cortex examined as well as throughout the rat cerebral cortex and in the subcortical white matter of both species. In monkey and rat cortex, SRIF-positive neurons are morphologically very similar to NPY-positive neurons. Of the total population of SRIF-positive and NPY-positive neurons in sensory-motor and parietal cortex of monkeys, a minimum of 24{\%} was immunoreactive for both peptides. Most cell bodies are small (8 to 10 micron in diameter) and are present through the depth of the cortex but are densest in layers II-III, in layer VI, and in the subjacent white matter. From the cell bodies several processes commonly emerge, branch two or three times, become beaded, and extend for long distances through the cortex. The fields formed by these processes vary from cell to cell; therefore, the usual morphological terms bipolar, multipolar, and so on do not adequately characterize the full population of neurons. Virtually every cell, however, has at least one long vertically oriented process, and most processes of white matter cells ascent into the cortex. No processes could be positively identified with the light microscope as axons. The processes of the peptide-positive neurons form dense plexuses in the cortex. In each area of monkey cortex, SRIF-positive and NPY-positive processes form a superficial plexus in layers I and II and a deep plexus in layer VI. These plexuses vary in density from area to area. All appear to arise from cortical or white matter cells rather than from extrinsic afferents. In some areas such as SI and areas 5 and 7, the superficial plexus extends deeply into layers III and IV; and in area 17, two very prominent middle plexuses occur in layers IIIB through IVB and in the upper one-third of layer V; these are separated by layer IVC, a major zone of thalamic terminations, which contains very few SRIF- or NPY-positive processes. The density of the plexuses is greater for NPY-positive processes than for SRIF-positive processes in all areas. In the rat, the plexuses do not display a strict laminar organization but generally are densest in the supragranular layers (I to III) and decline steadily in the deeper layers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Recent data suggest that neurons expressing three markers, the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST), and the ionotropic serotonin receptor 5HT3a (5HT3aR) account for nearly 100{\%} of neocortical interneurons. Interneurons expressing each of these markers have a different embryological origin. Each group includes several types of interneurons that differ in morphological and electrophysiological properties and likely have different functions in the cortical circuit. The PV group accounts for ∼40{\%} of GABAergic neurons and includes fast spiking basket cells and chandelier cells. The SST group, which represents ∼30{\%} of GABAergic neurons, includes the Martinotti cells and a set of neurons that specifically target layerIV. The 5HT3aR group, which also accounts for ∼30{\%} of the total interneuronal population, is heterogeneous and includes all of the neurons that express the neuropeptide VIP, as well as an equally numerous subgroup of neurons that do not express VIP and includes neurogliaform cells. The universal modulation of these neurons by serotonin and acetylcholine via ionotropic receptors suggests that they might be involved in shaping cortical circuits during specific brain states and behavioral contexts.},

Our results reveal distinct and shared female and male interaction-evoked patterns of male brain activation representing sex discrimination and social recognition.

In the cortex and other regions, the extent to which Fos induction during learning reveals specific sensory representations is unknown. Here we generate high-quality brain-wide maps of Fos mRNA expression during auditory fear conditioning and recall in the setting of the home cage. These maps reveal a brain-wide pattern of Fos induction that is remarkably similar among fear conditioning, shock-only, tone-only, and fear recall conditions, casting doubt on the idea that Fos reveals auditory-specific sensory representations. Indeed, novel auditory tones lead to as much gene induction in visual as in auditory cortex, while familiar (nonconditioned) tones do not appreciably induce Fos anywhere in the brain. Fos expression levels do not correlate with physical activity, suggesting that they are not determined by behavioral activity-driven alterations in sensory experience. In the thalamus, Fos is induced more prominently in limbic than in sensory relay nuclei, suggesting that Fos may be most sensitive to emotional state. Thus, our data suggest that Fos expression during simple associative learning labels ensembles activated generally by arousal rather than specifically by a particular sensory cue.},

Furthermore, we identify local cell type distributions with more cells in the female brain in 10 out of 11 sexually dimorphic subcortical areas, in contrast to the overall larger brains in males.

To date this system has not been effectively labeled by genetic markers, due largely to inadequate transcriptional specification by minimum promoter constructs.

Individual epithelial cells and a subset of lymphocytes within the gastrointestinal and airway mucosa are also labeled, indicating genetic evidence of acetylcholine biosynthesis. Central and peripheral neurons were observed as early as 10.5 days postcoitus in the developing mouse embryo. ChAT BAC -eGFP mice allow excellent visualization of all cholinergic elements of the peripheral nervous system, including the submucosal enteric plexus, preganglionic autonomic nerves, and skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle neuromuscular junctions. These mice should be useful for in vivo studies of cholinergic neurotransmission and neuromuscular coupling. Moreover, this genetic strategy allows the selective expression and conditional inactivation of genes of interest in cholinergic nerves of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. },

These mice help overcome the limitations of traditional approaches that examine an average of signaling events occurring in mixed populations of cells.

Thus, BAC transgenic mice are changing the way to conceive experiments and provide an opportunity to fill the gaps between molecular and systems neurosciences. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has garnered interest recently as a powerful model for the future of neuroscience research. Much of this excitement has centered on the species' reproductive biology and compatibility with gene editing techniques, which together have provided a path for transgenic marmosets to contribute to the study of disease as well as basic brain mechanisms. In step with technical advances is the need to establish experimental paradigms that optimally tap into the marmosets' behavioral and cognitive capacities. While conditioned task performance of a marmoset can compare unfavorably with rhesus monkey performance on conventional testing paradigms, marmosets' social behavior and cognition are more similar to that of humans. For example, marmosets are among only a handful of primates that, like humans, routinely pair bond and care cooperatively for their young. They are also notably pro-social and exhibit social cognitive abilities, such as imitation, that are rare outside of the Apes. In this Primer, we describe key facets of marmoset natural social behavior and demonstrate that emerging behavioral paradigms are well suited to isolate components of marmoset cognition that are highly relevant to humans. These approaches generally embrace natural behavior, which has been rare in conventional primate testing, and thus allow for a new consideration of neural mechanisms underlying primate social cognition and signaling. We anticipate that through parallel technical and paradigmatic advances, marmosets will become an essential model of human social behavior, including its dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access — prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types.},

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin in sections cut from livers of newborn, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 60-day-old rats were examined as examples. First, we compared average immunostaining intensity (sum of specific absorbance in pixel/number of pixels) measured by image processing (IP), with antigen content measured by immunochemical assay to determine whether the intensity is proportional to antigen content. The intensity of AFP was proportional to the antigen content, whereas that of albumin was not. Subsequently, the antigen preservation test was carried out to determine whether the intensity was decreased by fixation and, if so, which type of decrease (proportional or disproportionate) occurred. Thereafter, antigen content in the same portion in the same immunostained section was measured by the microphotometric (MP) method followed by the IP method, because the MP method gives a low average antigen content when a decrease in antibody binding occurs in sections, whereas the average antigen content measured by the IP method is unchanged. The intensity of AFP decreased primarily by a proportional decrease in antigenicity during fixation. However, the intensity of albumin decreased not only by a proportional decrease during fixation but also by a disproportionate reduction in antibody binding during immunostaining or before fixation. The results indicate that AFP content in sections is measurable by quantitative immunohistochemical methods, whereas albumin content is not.},

Here, we introduce a simple method that enables proteomic imaging for scalable, integrated, high-dimensional phenotyping of both animal tissues and human clinical samples. This method, termed SWITCH, uniformly secures tissue architecture, native biomolecules, and antigenicity across an entire system by synchronizing the tissue preservation reaction. The heat- and chemical-resistant nature of the resulting framework permits multiple rounds ({\textgreater}20) of relabeling. We have performed 22 rounds of labeling of a single tissue with precise co-registration of multiple datasets. Furthermore, SWITCH synchronizes labeling reactions to improve probe penetration depth and uniformity of staining. With SWITCH, we performed combinatorial protein expression profiling of the human cortex and also interrogated the geometric structure of the fiber pathways in mouse brains. Such integrated high-dimensional information may accelerate our understanding of biological systems at multiple levels.},

CUBIC-Atlas reflects inhomogeneous whole-brain development, revealing a significant decrease in the cerebral visual and somatosensory cortical areas during postnatal development.

Herein, we present techniques for tissue clearing in which whole organs and bodies are rendered macromolecule-permeable and optically transparent, thereby exposing their cellular structure with intact connectivity. We describe PACT (passive clarity technique), a protocol for passive tissue clearing and immunostaining of intact organs; RIMS (refractive index matching solution), a mounting media for imaging thick tissue; and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ), a method for whole-body clearing and immunolabeling. We show that in rodents PACT, RIMS, and PARS are compatible with endogenous-fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA single-molecule FISH, long-term storage, and microscopy with cellular and subcellular resolution.

abstract = {Acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter that modulates cortical functions. In addition to basal forebrain neurons that give rise to the principal cholinergic input into the cortex, a second source constituted by intrinsic cholinergic interneurons has been identified. Although these cells have been characterized anatomically, little is known about their functional role in cortical microcircuits. The paucity of this cell population has been a major hindrance for detailed electrophysiological investigations. To facilitate functional studies, we generated transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons. Aided by the transgene expression, the characterization of distinct cholinergic interneurons was possible. These cells were located in layer 2-3, had a bipolar morphology, were calretinin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide positive, but had a non-GABAergic phenotype. Paired recordings showed that EGFP/ChAT-positive neurons receive excitatory and inhibitory input from adjacent principal cells and various types of interneurons. However, EGFP/ChAT-positive neurons do not exert direct postsynaptic responses in neighboring neurons. Interestingly, prolonged activation of EGFP-labeled cholinergic neurons induces an increase in spontaneous EPSCs in adjacent pyramidal neurons. This indirect effect is mediated by nicotinic receptors that are presumably presynaptically localized. Thus, intrinsic bipolar cholinergic neurons can modulate cortical function locally.

However, currently available atlases of the marmoset brain are mainly based on 2D histological data, which are difficult to apply to 3D imaging techniques. Here, we constructed a 3D digital atlas based on high-resolution ex-vivo MRI images, including magnetization transfer ratio (a T1-like contrast), T2w images, and multi-shell diffusion MRI. Based on the multi-modal MRI images, we manually delineated 54 cortical areas and 16 subcortical regions on one hemisphere of the brain (the core version). The 54 cortical areas were merged into 13 larger cortical regions according to their locations to yield a coarse version of the atlas, and also parcellated into 106 sub-regions using a connectivity-based parcellation method to produce a refined atlas. Finally, we compared the new atlas set with existing histology atlases and demonstrated its applications in connectome studies, and in resting state and stimulus-based fMRI. The atlas set has been integrated into the widely-distributed neuroimaging data analysis software AFNI and SUMA, providing a readily usable multi-modal template space with multi-level anatomical labels (including labels from the Paxinos atlas) that can facilitate various neuroimaging studies of marmosets.},

abstract = {Molecular genetic tools have had a profound impact on neuroscience, but until recently their application has largely been confined to a few model species, most notably mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. With the development of new genome engineering technologies such as CRISPR, it is becoming increasingly feasible to apply these molecular tools in a wider range of species, including nonhuman primates. This will lead to many opportunities for brain research, but it will also pose challenges. Here we identify some of these opportunities and challenges in light of recent and foreseeable technological advances and offer some suggestions. Our main focus is on the creation of new primate disease models for understanding the pathological mechanisms of brain disorders and for developing new approaches to effective treatment. However, we also emphasize that primate genetic models have great potential to address many fundamental questions about brain function, providing an essential foundation for future progress in disease research.},

abstract = {Intravenous administration of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-PHP.B, a capsid variant of AAV9 containing seven amino acid insertions, results in a greater permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) than standard AAV9 in mice, leading to highly efficient and global transduction of the central nervous system (CNS). The present study aimed to examine whether the enhanced BBB penetrance of AAV-PHP.B observed in mice also occurs in non-human primates. Thus, a young adult (age, 1.6 years) and an old adult (age, 7.2 years) marmoset received an intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.B expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the constitutive CBh promoter (a hybrid of cytomegalovirus early enhancer and chicken $\beta$-actin promoter). Age-matched control marmosets were treated with standard AAV9-capsid vectors. The animals were sacrificed 6 weeks after the viral injection. Based on the results, only limited transduction of neurons (0–2{\%}) and astrocytes (0.1–2.5{\%}) was observed in both AAV-PHP.B- and AAV9-treated marmosets. One noticeable difference between AAV-PHP.B and AAV9 was the marked transduction of the peripheral dorsal root ganglia neurons. Indeed, the soma and axons in the projection from the spinal cord to the nucleus cuneatus in the medulla oblongata were strongly labeled with EGFP by AAV-PHP.B. Thus, except for the peripheral dorsal root ganglia neurons, the AAV-PHP.B transduction efficiency in the CNS of marmosets was comparable to that of AAV9 vectors.},

abstract = {In this paper, the use of surfactants for solubilization of hydrophobic organic dyes (mainly solvent and disperse dyes) has been reviewed. The effect of parameters such as the chemical structures of the surfactant and the dye, addition of salt and of polyelectrolytes, pH, and temperature on dye solubilization has been discussed. Surfactant self-assemble into micelles in aqueous solution and below the concentration where this occurs-the critical micelle concentration (CMC)-there is no solubilization. Above the CMC, the amount of solubilized dye increases linearly with the increase in surfactant concentration. It is demonstrated that different surfactants work best for different dyes. In general, nonionic surfactants have higher solubilization power than anionic and cationic surfactants. It is likely that the reason for the good performance of nonionic surfactants is that they allow dyes to be accommodated not only in the inner, hydrocarbon part of the micelle but also in the headgroup shell. It is demonstrated that the location of a dye in a surfactant micelle can be assessed from the absorption spectrum of the dye-containing micellar solution.{\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Every brain structure annotated in the Atlas is assigned a distinct color based on its hierarchical position in the brain, which not only provides visual effects to emphasize brain organization, but also facilitates unique definition and segmentation, which is critical to informatics processing and computer-generated 3D reconstruction in the online Allen Brain Atlas. In addition, more than 80 genes showing unique expression patterns in the brain were selected and are presented with the brain map images as molecular markers, for substantially increasing the accuracy of brain structure delineations. Also included are extremely useful text materials such as annotated nomenclature tables, comprehensive indices, lists of abbreviations, and a thorough and up-to-date bibliography.

Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes.

As a result, in vitro approaches to model human brain development and disease are an intense area of research. Here we describe a recently established protocol for generating 3D brain tissue, so-called cerebral organoids, which closely mimics the endogenous developmental program. This method can easily be implemented in a standard tissue culture room and can give rise to developing cerebral cortex, ventral telencephalon, choroid plexus and retinal identities, among others, within 1-2 months. This straightforward protocol can be applied to developmental studies, as well as to the study of a variety of human brain diseases. Furthermore, as organoids can be maintained for more than 1 year in long-term culture, they also have the potential to model later events such as neuronal maturation and survival.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved. Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked, neurodevelopmental disorder caused primarily by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, which encodes a multifunctional epigenetic regulator with known links to a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although postnatal functions of MeCP2 have been thoroughly investigated, its role in prenatal brain development remains poorly understood. Given the well-established importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurogenesis, we employed isogenic human RTT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and MeCP2 short hairpin RNA knockdown approaches to identify novel MeCP2-regulated miRNAs enriched during early human neuronal development. Focusing on the most dysregulated miRNAs, we found miR-199 and miR-214 to be increased during early brain development and to differentially regulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) signaling. In parallel, we characterized the effects on human neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation brought about by MeCP2 deficiency using both monolayer and three-dimensional (cerebral organoid) patient-derived and MeCP2-deficient neuronal culture models. Inhibiting miR-199 or miR-214 expression in iPSC-derived neural progenitors deficient in MeCP2 restored AKT and ERK activation, respectively, and ameliorated the observed alterations in neuronal differentiation. Moreover, overexpression of miR-199 or miR-214 in the wild-type mouse embryonic brains was sufficient to disturb neurogenesis and neuronal migration in a similar manner to Mecp2 knockdown. Taken together, our data support a novel miRNA-mediated pathway downstream of MeCP2 that influences neurogenesis via interactions with central molecular hubs linked to autism spectrum disorders.},

abstract = {Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a recently discovered mRNA in rat brain, upregulated in the nucleus accumbens after administration of cocaine and amphetamine. All data until now suggest a widespread distribution of this mRNA in the brain and endocrine tissues. The aim of this study was to precisely map and desrcibe this mRNA product - CART peptide immunoreactive (IR) neurons in rat amygdala (AMY) by using immunohistochemical methods. Distribution and density of CART -IR neurons in AMY was very different. The greatest density was in the lateral nucleus (La) and basolateral nucleus (BL) of AMY, and in Anterior Amygdaloid Area (AAA), moderate was in the central nucleus (Ce) and a small density was in the cortical posterior nucleus (CoP). By analysing the morphology of CART- IR neurons in AMY, we found that the greatest number (43.75{\%}) of these neurons has a bipolar shape. About 15{\%} of investigated CART IR neurons are "bitufted" neurons, while an equal percentage is of multipolar (12.5{\%}) and of ovoid neurons (12.5{\%}). CART-IR neurons of pyramidal shape are present in about 9{\%}, while the smallest number is of triangular neurons (6.25{\%}). The largest CART-IR neurons are in La and, neurons with the smallest long diameter are present in BL AMY. Even if there is not any morphologically distinct CART-IR neuron type in rat AMY, these neurons mainly are small and oval in most of AMY nuclei where they are usually present This suggests the functional role of a majority of CART-IR neurons in rat AMY, especially in BL, as small interneurons. The small number of large neurons could be projection neurons.},
