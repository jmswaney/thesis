# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to acknowledge all of my colleagues at MIT for their continued
support throughout various research projects. Although challenging at times, we
managed to accomplish a great deal and learn even more together over the last
five years. I have no doubt that those individuals that I have had the privilege
to work with at MIT will continue to impact the world in positive ways.

I would also like to thank my students, whether through my role as a teaching
assistant or as a undergraduate research supervisor, for teaching me. You may
not have realized that I was also learning from the experience, but it was a
constant reminder of how important it is to give back to the next generation of
problem-solvers. If we can provide them with the tools, then there is no
problem too large for the curiosity of a young scientist.

This work never would have been possible without my family. I am grateful for my
fianceÃÅ, Kassi, who has been with me side-by-side as an MIT PhD student since
the beginning. We made it through grad school together, and I'm excited to share
our hardships and victories in the future. My brother, Jason, and his wife,
Shanon, always gave me a place to stay whenever I went home to Wisconsin during
my PhD. My sister, Amy, and neice, Lexi, also welcomed me home when I visited.
My dad, Rich, has supported me throughout my entire life and academic career. 

Lastly, I'd like to dedicate this thesis to my mother, Margaret Swaney, to whom
I owe everything. She has been and will always be my guiding light.
