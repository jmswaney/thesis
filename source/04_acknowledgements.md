# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I would like to acknowledge all of my colleagues at MIT for their continued support throughout various research projects. We accomplished a great deal and learned even more together. I have no doubt that those individuals that I have had the privilege to work with at MIT will continue to impact the world in positive ways.

This work never would have been possible without my family. I am grateful for my fianceÃÅ, Kassi, who has been with me side-by-side as an MIT PhD student since the beginning. We made it through grad school together, and I'm excited to share our hardships and victories in the future. My brother, Jason, and his wife, Shanon, always gave me a place to stay whenever I went home to Wisconsin during my PhD. My sister, Amy, and neice, Lexi, also welcomed me home when I visited. My dad, Rich, has supported me throughout my entire life and academic career. 

Lastly, I'd like to dedicate this thesis to my mother, Margaret Swaney, to whom I owe everything. She has been and will always be my guiding light.
