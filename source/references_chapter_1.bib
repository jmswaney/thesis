This process creates a tissue-hydrogel hybrid that is physically stable, that preserves fine structure, proteins and nucleic acids, and that is permeable to both visible-spectrum photons and exogenous macromolecules. Here we highlight relevant challenges and opportunities of this approach, especially with regard to integration with complementary methodologies for brain-mapping studies.},

To maximize physical coverage, we developed the SiMView technology framework for high-speed in vivo imaging, which records multiple views of the specimen simultaneously. SiMView consists of a light-sheet microscope with four synchronized optical arms, real-time electronics for long-term sCMOS-based image acquisition at 175 million voxels per second, and computational modules for high-throughput image registration, segmentation, tracking and real-time management of the terabytes of multiview data recorded per specimen. We developed one-photon and multiphoton SiMView implementations and recorded cellular dynamics in entire Drosophila melanogaster embryos with 30-s temporal resolution throughout development. We furthermore performed high-resolution long-term imaging of the developing nervous system and followed neuroblast cell lineages in vivo. SiMView data sets provide quantitative morphological information even for fast global processes and enable accurate automated cell tracking in the entire early embryo.},

abstract = {Nondestructive chemical processing of porous samples such as fixed biological tissues typically relies on molecular diffusion. Diffusion into a porous structure is a slow process that significantly delays completion of chemical processing. Here, we present a novel electrokinetic method termed stochastic electrotransport for rapid nondestructive processing of porous samples. This method uses a rotational electric field to selectively disperse highly electromobile molecules throughout a porous sample without displacing the low-electromobility molecules that constitute the sample. Using computational models, we show that stochastic electrotransport can rapidly disperse electromobile molecules in a porous medium. We apply this method to completely clear mouse organs within 1-3 days and to stain them with nuclear dyes, proteins, and antibodies within 1 day. Our results demonstrate the potential of stochastic electrotransport to process large and dense tissue samples that were previously infeasible in time when relying on diffusion.},

abstract = {Calcium binding proteins (CBPs) regulate intracellular levels of calcium (Ca(2+)) ions. CBPs are particularly interesting from a morphological standpoint, because they are differentially expressed in certain sub-populations of cells in the nervous system of various species of vertebrate animals. However, knowledge on the cellular regulation governing such cell-specific CBP expression is still incomplete. In this work on the L7 segment of the cat spinal cord, we analyzed the localization and morphology of neurons expressing the CBPs calbindin-28 KD (CB), parvalbumin (PV), and calretinin (CR), and co-expressing CB and PV, CB and CR, and PV and CR. Single CBP-positive ((+)) neurons showed specific distributions: (1) CB was present in small neurons localized in laminae I, II, III and X, in small to medium size neurons in laminae III-VI, and in medium to large neurons in laminae VI-VIII; (2) PV was present in small size neurons in laminae III and IV and in medial portions of laminae V and VI, medium neurons and in lamina X at the border with lamina VII, in medium to large neurons in laminae VII and VIII; (3) CR labeling was detected in small size neurons in laminae I, II, III and VIII, in medium to large size neurons in laminae I and III-VII, and in small to medium size neurons in lamina X. Double labeled neurons were a small minority of the CBP(+) cells. Co-expression of CB and PV was seen in 1 to 2{\%} of the CBP(+) cells, and they were detected in the ventral and intermediate portions of lamina VII and in lamina X. Co-localization of CB and CR was present in 0.3{\%} of the cells and these cells were localized in lamina II. Double labeling for PV and CR occurred in 6{\%} of the cells, and the cells were localized in ventral part of lamina VII and in lamina VIII. Overall, these results revealed distinct and reproducible patterns of localization of the neurons expressing single CBPs and co-expressing two of them. Distinct differences of CBP expression between cat and other species are discussed. Possible relations between the cat L7 neurons expressing different CBPs with the neurons previously analyzed in cat and other animals are suggested.},

Because these reporters exhibit spectral and spatial overlap when used simultaneously, multiplexed IHC is not routinely used in clinical settings. We have developed a method that uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to image antibodies tagged with isotopically pure elemental metal reporters. Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) is capable of analyzing up to 100 targets simultaneously over a five-log dynamic range.

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, exposure of axons to A$\beta$ causes pathogenic changes that spread retrogradely by unknown mechanisms, affecting the entire neuron. We found that locally applied A$\beta$1-42 initiates axonal synthesis of a defined set of proteins including the transcription factor ATF4. Inhibition of local translation and retrograde transport or knockdown of axonal Atf4 mRNA abolished A$\beta$-induced ATF4 transcriptional activity and cell loss. A$\beta$1-42 injection into the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice caused loss of forebrain neurons whose axons project to the DG. Protein synthesis and Atf4 mRNA were upregulated in these axons, and coinjection of Atf4 siRNA into the DG reduced the effects of A$\beta$1-42 in the forebrain. ATF4 protein and transcripts were found with greater frequency in axons in the brain of AD patients. These results reveal an active role for intra-axonal translation in neurodegeneration and identify ATF4 as a mediator for the spread of AD pathology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Multiple calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) are expressed at high levels and in complementary patterns in the auditory pathways of birds, mammals, and other vertebrates, but whether specific members of the CaBP family can be used to identify neuronal subpopulations is unclear. We used double immunofluorescence labeling of calretinin (CR) in combination with neuronal markers to investigate the distribution of CR-expressing neurons in brainstem sections of the cochlear nucleus in the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). While CR was homogeneously expressed in cochlear nucleus magnocellularis, CR expression was highly heterogeneous in cochlear nucleus angularis (NA), a nucleus with diverse cell types analogous in function to neurons in the mammalian ventral cochlear nucleus. To quantify the distribution of CR in the total NA cell population, we used antibodies against neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), a postmitotic neuron-specific nuclear marker. In NA neurons, NeuN label was variably localized to the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm, and the intensity of NeuN immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with the intensity of CR immunoreactivity. The percentage of CR + neurons in NA increased from 31 {\%} in embryonic (E)17/18 chicks, to 44 {\%} around hatching (E21), to 51 {\%} in postnatal day (P) 8 chicks. By P8, the distribution of CR + neurons was uniform, both rostrocaudal and in the tonotopic (dorsoventral) axis. Immunoreactivity for the voltage-gated potassium ion channel Kv1.1, used as a marker for physiological type, showed broad and heterogeneous postsynaptic expression in NA, but did not correlate with CR expression. These results suggest that CR may define a subpopulation of neurons within nucleus angularis.},

abstract = {A monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nonphosphorylated epitope on the 168 kDa and 200 kDa subunits of neurofilament proteins has been used in an immunohistochemical study of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) and human neocortex. This antibody, SMI-32, primarily labels the cell body and dendrites of a subset of pyramidal neurons in both species. A greater proportion of neocortical pyramidal neurons were SMI-32 immunoreactive (ir) in the human than in the monkey. SMI-32-ir neurons exhibited consistent differences in the intensity of their immunoreactivity that correlated with cell size. The cellular specificity of SMI-32 immunoreactivity suggests that a subpopulation of neurons can be distinguished on the basis of differences in the molecular characteristics of basic cytoskeletal elements such as neurofilament proteins. The size, density, and laminar distribution of SMI-32-ir neurons differed substantially across neocortical areas within each species and between species. Differences across cortical areas were particularly striking in the monkey. For example, the anterior parainsular cortex had a substantial population of large SMI-32-ir neurons in layer V and a near absence of any immunoreactive neurons in the supragranular layers. This contrasted with the cortical area located more laterally on the superior temporal gyrus, where layers III and V contained substantial populations of large SMI-32-ir neurons. Both areas differed significantly from the posterior inferior temporal gyrus, which was distinguished by a bimodal distribution of large SMI-32-ir neurons in layer III. Differences across human areas were less obvious because of the increase in the number of SMI-32-ir neurons. Perhaps the most notable differences across human areas resulted from shifts in the density of the larger SMI-32-ir neurons in deep layer III. A comparison between the species revealed that isocortical areas exhibited greater differences in their representation of SMI-32-ir neurons than primary sensory or transitional cortical areas. A comparison of distribution patterns of SMI-32-ir neurons across monkey cortical areas and data available on the laminar organization of cortical efferent neurons suggests that a common anatomic characteristic of this chemically identified subpopulation of neurons is that they have a distant axonal projection. Such correlations of cell biological characteristics with specific elements of cortical circuitry will further our understanding of the molecular and cellular properties that are critically linked to a given neuron's role in cortical structure and function.},

NeuN has also been used to define post-mitotic neurons or differentiating neuronal precursors in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate that the NeuN mAb labels the nuclei of astrocytes cultured from fetal and adult human, newborn rat, and embryonic mouse brain tissue. A non-neuronal fibroblast cell line (3T3) also displayed NeuN immunoreactivity. We confirmed that NeuN labels neurons but not astrocytes in sections of P10 rat brain. Western blot analysis of NeuN immunoreactive species revealed a distribution of bands in nucleus-enriched fractions derived from the different cell lines that was similar, but not identical to adult rat brain homogenates. We then examined the hypothesis that the glial fibrillary acidic protein/NeuN-double positive population of cells might correspond to neuronal precursors. Although the NeuN-positive astrocytes were proliferating, no evidence of neurogenesis was detected. Furthermore, expression of additional neuronal precursor markers was not detected. Our results indicate that primary astrocytes derived from mouse, rat, and human brain express NeuN. Our findings are consistent with NeuN being a selective marker of neurons in vivo, but indicate that studies utilizing NeuN-immunoreactivity as a definitive marker of post-mitotic neurons in vitro should be interpreted with caution.},

Yet little is known about the organization of visual brain structures in the species closest to humans--the apes--thus, making it difficult to evaluate hypotheses about recent evolutionary changes. The primate visual cortex is comprised of numerous cytoarchitectonically distinct areas, each of which has a specific role in the processing of visual stimuli. We examined the histological organization of striate (V1) and 2 extrastriate (V2 and ventral posterior) cortical areas in humans, 5 ape species, and a macaque. The cytoarchitectural patterns of visual areas were compared across species using quantitative descriptions of cell volume densities and laminar patterns. We also investigated potential scaling relationships between cell volume density and several brain, body, and visual system variables. The results suggest that interspecific variability in the cytoarchitectural organization of visual system structures can arise independently of global brain and body size scaling relationships. In particular, species-specific differences in cell volume density seem to be most closely linked to the size of structures in the visual system.},

Furthermore, the connections between CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons in these visual areas were investigated at the light microscope level by using a dual-immunocytochemical staining procedure. The most significant findings were three-fold. First, the number and distribution of CB-ir and CR-ir double-bouquet cells and PV-ir chandelier cells differed considerably between different visual areas. In particular, the different distribution of double-bouquet cells was illustrated dramatically at the V1/V2 border, where CB-ir double-bouquet axons were very few or lacking in V1 but were very numerous in V2. Furthermore, PV-ir chandelier cell terminals were relatively sparse in V1, more frequent in V2, and most frequent in area TE. Second, the percentage of CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons receiving multiple contacts on their somata and proximal dendrites from other calcium-binding protein neurons varied between 22{\%} and 85{\%}. The highest percentage of contacts found between immunolabelled cells and multiterminals were for the combinations CR/CB (76-85{\%}; percent of cells immunoreactive for CB that were innervated by multiterminals immunoreactive for CR), followed by the combination PV/CR (42-48{\%}), and then by the other combinations that had similar percentages (22-32{\%} for CR/PV; 26-37{\%} for CB/CR; 29-42{\%} for CR/PV). Third, differences in the relative proportions of CB, CR, and PV terminals in contact with CB-, CR-, and PV-ir neurons were consistent between the different cortical areas studied. Thus, certain characteristics of intraareal circuits differ, whereas others remain similar, in different areas of the occipitotemporal visual pathway. The differences may represent regional specializations related to the different processing of visual stimuli, whereas the similarities may be attributed to general functional requisites for interneuronal circuitry.},

abstract = {Enzymatic and nonenzymatic browning reactions of amino acids and proteins with carbohydrates, oxidized lipids, and oxidized phenols cause deterioration of food during storage and processing. The loss in nutritional quality and potentially in safety is attributed to destruction of essential amino acids, decrease in digestibility, inhibition of proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes, interaction with metal ions, and formation of antinutritional and toxic compounds. Studies in this area include influence of damage to essential amino acids on nutrition and food safety, nutritional damage as a function of processing conditions, and simultaneous formation of deleterious and beneficial compounds. These compounds include kidney-damaging Maillard reaction products, mutagens, carcinogens, antimutagens, antioxidants, antibiotics, and antiallergens. This overview covers the formation, nutrition, and safety of glycated proteins, characterized browning products, and heterocyclic amines. Possible approaches to inhibiting browning reactions and preventing adverse effects of browning during food processing and food consumption, including protection against adverse effects of heterocyclic amines by N-acetylcysteine, caffeine, chlorophyll, conjugated linoleic acid, lignin, and tea extracts, are also described. This research subject covers a complex relationship of the chemistry, biology, and pathology of browning products and the impact on human nutrition and health. Future study should differentiate antinutritional and toxicological relationships, define individual and combined potencies of browning products, and develop means to prevent the formation and to minimize the adverse manifestations of the most antinutritional and toxic compounds. Such studies should lead to better and safer foods and improved human health},

abstract = {The majority of cortical interneurons use GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) as inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABAergic neurons are morphologically, connectionally, electrically and chemically heterogeneous. In rat cerebral cortex three distinct groups of GABAergic interneurons have been identified by the expression of parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR) and somatostatin (SOM). Recent studies in mouse cerebral cortex have revealed a different organization in which the CR and SOM populations are partially overlapping. Because CR and SOM neurons derive from different progenitors located in different embryonic structures, the coexpression of CR + SOM suggests that the chemical differentiation of interneurons is regulated postmitotically. Here, we have taken an important first step towards understanding this process by triple immunostaining mouse visual cortex with a panel of antibodies, which has been used extensively for classifying developing interneurons. We have found at least 13 distinct groups of GABAergic neurons which include PV, CR, SOM, CCK (cholecystokinin), CR + SOM, CR + NPY (neuropeptide Y), CR + VIP (vasointestinal polypeptide), SOM + NPY, SOM + VIP, VIP + ChAT (choline acetyltransferase), CCK + NPY, CR + SOM + NPY and CR + SOM + VIP expressing cells. Triple immunostaining with PV, CR and SOM antibodies during postnatal development further showed that PV is never colocalized with CR and SOM. Importantly, expression of SOM and CR + SOM developed after the percentage of CR cells that do not express SOM has reached the mature level, suggesting that the chemical differentiation of SOM and CR + SOM neurons is a postnatal event, which may be controlled by transcriptional regulation.},

abstract = {We establish high-sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as a fast, reliable, and versatile tool for assessing membrane translocation of charged compounds. A combination of ITC uptake and release titrations can discriminate between the two extreme cases of half-sided binding and complete transbilayer equilibration on the experimental time scale. To this end, we derive a general fit function for both assays that allows for incorporation of different membrane partitioning models. Electrostatic effects are taken into account with the aid of Gouy-Chapman theory, thus rendering uptake and release experiments amenable to the investigation of charged solutes. This is exemplified for the flip-flop of the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) across the membranes of 100-nm-diameter unilamellar vesicles composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) in aqueous solution (10 mM phosphate buffer, 154 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). If repulsive electrostatic forces are accounted for adequately, SDS binding to POPC membranes can be evaluated on the basis of ideal mixing in all phases. At 25 degrees C, the intrinsic partition coefficient between the interfacial aqueous phase and the membrane amounts to 3.5 x 10(6); however, detergent flip-flop is negligibly slow under these conditions. Raising the temperature to 65 degrees C lowers the intrinsic partition coefficient to 1.4 x 10(6) but enables rapid transbilayer distribution of the detergent and, therefore, binding to or desorption from both membrane leaflets. Thus, combining a surface partition equilibrium with simple electrostatic theory appears highly useful in monitoring transmembrane movement of ionic compounds by ITC, thereby eliminating the need for specific reporter groups.},

abstract = {NeuN (neuronal nuclei) is a neuron-specific nuclear protein which is identified by immunoreactivity with a monoclonal antibody, anti-NeuN. Anti-NeuN has been used widely as a reliable tool to detect most postmitotic neuronal cell types in neuroscience, developmental biology, and stem cell research fields as well as diagnostic histopathology. To date, however, the identity of its antigen, NeuN itself, has been unknown. Here, we identify NeuN as the Fox-3 gene product by providing the following evidence: 1) Mass spectrometry analysis of anti-NeuN immunoreactive protein yields the Fox-3 amino acid sequence. 2) Recombinant Fox-3 is recognized by anti-NeuN. 3) Short hairpin RNAs targeting Fox-3 mRNA down-regulate NeuN expression. 4) Fox-3 expression is restricted to neural tissues. 5) Anti-Fox-3 immunostaining and anti-NeuN immunostaining overlap completely in neuronal nuclei. We also show that a protein cross-reactive with anti-NeuN is the synaptic vesicle protein, synapsin I. Anti-NeuN recognizes synapsin I in immunoblots with one order of magnitude lower affinity than Fox-3, and does not recognize synapsin I using immunohistology. Fox-3 (also called hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 3 and D11Bwg0517e) contains an RNA recognition motif and is classified as a member of the Fox-1 gene family that binds specifically to an RNA element, UGCAUG. We demonstrate that Fox-3 functions as a splicing regulator using neural cell-specific alternative splicing of the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B pre-mRNA as a model. Identification of NeuN as Fox-3 clarifies an important element of neurobiology research.},

In neither of these areas was there a significant difference between Alzheimer and control groups in the mean number of PV, CR, or CB immunoreactive neuronal profiles, counted in a cortical column going from pia to white matter. Significant differences in the mean densities (numbers per square millimeter of cortex) of PV, CR, and CB immunoreactive neuronal profiles were not observed either between groups or areas, but only between superficial, middle, and deep layers within areas 17 and 18. The optical density of the immunoreactive neuropil was also similar in Alzheimer and controls, correlating with the numerical density of immunoreactive profiles in superficial, middle, and deep layers. The frequency distribution of neuronal areas indicated significant differences between PV, CR, and CB immunoreactive neuronal profiles in both areas 17 and 18, with more large PV than CR and CB positive profiles. There were also significantly more small and less large PV and CR immunoreactive neuronal profiles in Alzheimer than in controls. Our data show that, although the brain pathology is moderate to severe, there is no prominent decrease of PV, CR and CB positive neurons in the visual cortex of Alzheimer brains, but only selective changes in neuronal perikarya.},

We further applied this approach to STED images of GPI-anchored and model transmembrane proteins expressed in mammalian cells.

Recent in vivo studies have shown that intracellular calcium levels in astrocytes correlate with reactivity in adjacent diving arterioles. However, the hemodynamic response to stimulation involves a complex orchestration of vessel dilations and constrictions that spread rapidly over wide distances. In this work, we study the three-dimensional cytoarchitecture of astrocytes and their interrelations with blood vessels down through layer IV of the mouse somatosensory cortex using in vivo two-photon microscopy. Vessels and astrocytes were visualized through intravenous dextran-conjugated fluorescein and cortically applied sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), respectively. In addition to exploring astrocyte density, vascular proximity, and microvascular density, we found that sheathing of subpial vessels by astrocyte processes was continuous along all capillaries, arterioles, and veins, comprising a highly interconnected pathway through which signals could feasibly be relayed over long distances via gap junctions. An inner SR101-positive sheath noted along pial and diving arterioles was determined to be nonastrocytic, and appears to represent selective SR101 staining of arterial endothelial cells. Our findings underscore the intimate relationship between astrocytes and all cortical blood vessels, and suggest that astrocytes could influence neurovascular regulation at a range of sites, including the capillary bed and pial arterioles. {\textcopyright} 2011 ISCBFM All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Do antibody combining sites possess general properties that enable them to bind different antigens with varying affinities and to bind novel antigens? Here, we address this question by examining the physical and chemical characteristics most favourable for residues involved in antigen accommodation and binding. Amphipathic amino acids could readily tolerate the change of environment from hydrophilic to hydrophobic that occurs upon antibody-antigen complex formation. Residues that are large and can participate in a wide variety of van der Waals' and electrostatic interactions would permit binding to a range of antigens. Amino acids with flexible side-chains could generate a structurally plastic region, i.e. a binding site possessing the ability to mould itself around the antigen to improve complementarity of the interacting surfaces. Hence, antibodies could bind to an array of novel antigens using a limited set of residues interspersed with more unique residues to which greater binding specificity can be attributed. An individual antibody molecule could thus be cross-reactive and have the capacity to bind structurally similar ligands. The accommodation of variations in antigenic structure by modest combining site flexibility could make an important contribution to immune defence by allowing antibody binding to distinct but closely related pathogens. Tyr and Trp most readily fulfil these catholic physicochemical requirements and thus would be expected to be common in combining sites on theoretical grounds. Experimental support for this comes from three sources, (1) the high frequency of participation by these amino acids in the antigen binding observed in six crystallographically determined antibody-antigen complexes, (2) their frequent occurrence in the putative binding regions of antibodies as determined from structural and sequence data and (3) the potential for movement of their side-chains in known antibody binding sites and model systems. The six bound antigens comprise two small different haptens, non-overlapping regions of the same large protein and a 19 amino acid residue peptide. Out of a total of 85 complementarity determining region positions, only 37 locations (plus 3 framework) are directly involved in antigen interaction. Of these, light chain residue 91 is utilized by all the complexes examined, whilst light chain 32, light chain 96 and heavy chain 33 are employed by five out of the six. The binding sites in known antibody-antigen complexes as well as the postulated combining sites in free Fab fragments show similar characteristics with regard to the types of amino acids present. The possible role of other amino acids is also assessed. Potential implications for the combining regions of class I major histocompatibility molecules and the rational design of molecules are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The expression of NeuN is observed in most neuronal cell types throughout the nervous system of adult mice. However, some major cell types appear devoid of immunoreactivity including cerebellar Purkinje cells, olfactory bulb mitral cells, and retinal photoreceptor cells. NeuN can also be detected in neurons in primary cerebellar cultures and in retinoic acid-stimulated P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Immunohistochemically detectable NeuN protein first appears at developmental timepoints which correspond with the withdrawal of the neuron from the cell cycle and/or with the initiation of terminal differentiation of the neuron. NeuN is a soluble nuclear protein, appears as 3 bands (46-48 x 10(3) M(r)) on immunoblots, and binds to DNA in vitro. The mAb crossreacts immunohistochemically with nervous tissue from rats, chicks, humans, and salamanders. This mAb and the protein recognized by it serve as an excellent marker for neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems in both the embryo and adult, and the protein may be important in the determination of neuronal phenotype.},

We show that optogenetic activation of subfornical organ excitatory neurons, marked by the expression of the transcription factor ETV-1, evokes intense drinking behaviour, and does so even in fully water-satiated animals. The light-induced response is highly specific for water, immediate and strictly locked to the laser stimulus. In contrast, activation of a second population of subfornical organ neurons, marked by expression of the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, drastically suppresses drinking, even in water-craving thirsty animals. These results reveal an innate brain circuit that can turn an animal's water-drinking behaviour on and off, and probably functions as a centre for thirst control in the mammalian brain.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PARK2 mutations cause early-onset forms of PD. PARK2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, that can selectively translocate to dysfunctional mitochondria to promote their removal by autophagy. However, Parkin knockout (KO) mice do not display signs of neurodegeneration. To assess Parkin function invivo, we utilized a mouse model that accumulates dysfunctional mitochondria caused by an accelerated generation of mtDNA mutations (Mutator mice). In the absence of Parkin, dopaminergic neurons in Mutator mice degenerated causing an L-DOPA reversible motor deficit. Other neuronal populations were unaffected. Phosphorylated ubiquitin was increased in the brains of Mutator mice, indicating PINK1-Parkin activation. Parkin losscaused mitochondrial dysfunction and affected the pathogenicity but not the levels of mtDNA somatic mutations. A systemic loss of Parkin synergizes with mitochondrial dysfunction causing dopaminergic neuron death modeling PD pathogenic processes. Recessive mutations in Parkin contribute to Parkinson's disease. Pickrell and Huang etal. use a mouse model to discover endogenous Parkin preferentially protects dopaminergic neurons from mitochondrial dysfunction.},

Despite this, there is little quantitative data on spatial distributions of specific types of synaptic input. Here we use array tomography (AT), a high-resolution optical microscopy method, to examine thalamocortical (TC) input onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We first verified the ability of AT to identify synapses using parallel electron microscopic analysis of TC synapses in layer 4. We then use large-scale array tomography (LSAT) to measure TC synapse distribution on L5 pyramidal neurons in a 1.00 × 0.83 × 0.21 mm 3  volume of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that TC synapses primarily target basal dendrites in layer 5, but also make a considerable input to proximal apical dendrites in L4, consistent with previous work. Our analysis further suggests that TC inputs are biased toward certain branches and, within branches, synapses show significant clustering with an excess of TC synapse nearest neighbors within 5-15 $\mu$m compared to a random distribution. Thus, we show that AT is a sensitive and quantitative method to map specific types of synaptic input on the dendrites of entire neurons. We anticipate that this technique will be of wide utility for mapping functionally-relevant anatomical connectivity in neural circuits. {\textcopyright} 2013 Rah, Bas, Colonell, Mishchenko, Karsh, Fetter, Myers, Chklovskii, Svoboda, Harris and Isaac.},

It also permitted imaging of single degenerating axons in adult brain and the first visualization of cleaved Caspase-3 in degenerating embryonic sensory axons in vivo, even single axons. iDISCO enables facile volume imaging of immunolabeled structures in complex tissues.

abstract = {Biological specimens are intrinsically three dimensional; however, because of the obscuring effects of light scatter, imaging deep into a tissue volume is problematic. Although efforts to eliminate the scatter by "clearing" the tissue have been ongoing for over a century, there have been a large number of recent innovations. This Review introduces the physical basis for light scatter in tissue, describes the mechanisms underlying various clearing techniques, and discusses several of the major advances in light microscopy for imaging cleared tissue.},

abstract = {The cross-linking characteristics of biological tissues fixed by various epoxy compounds with different chemical structures (i.e, number of epoxide functional groups and backbone length) were investigated. Generally speaking, the tissues fixed with monofunctional fixatives were more pliable than those fixed with multifunctional fixatives. The fixation indices of the fixed tissues did not seem to be affected by the chemical structures of the fixatives. However, the number of functional groups and backbone length of the fixatives did play an important role in influencing the denaturation temperatures of the fixed tissues. In general, the denaturation temperatures of the multifunctional fixed tissues were higher than those of the monofunctional fixed tissues. Among the monofunctional fixed tissues, it was found that increasing the backbone length of the fixative decreased the denaturation temperature of the fixed tissue. This effect was present until the backbone length of the fixative became large enough.},

abstract = {Systems-level identification and analysis of cellular circuits in the brain will require the development of whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution. To this end, we performed comprehensive chemical screening to develop a whole-brain clearing and imaging method, termed CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain imaging cocktails and computational analysis). CUBIC is a simple and efficient method involving the immersion of brain samples in chemical mixtures containing aminoalcohols, which enables rapid whole-brain imaging with single-photon excitation microscopy. CUBIC is applicable to multicolor imaging of fluorescent proteins or immunostained samples in adult brains and is scalable from a primate brain to subcellular structures. We also developed a whole-brain cell-nuclear counterstaining protocol and a computational image analysis pipeline that, together with CUBIC reagents, enable the visualization and quantification of neural activities induced by environmental stimulation. CUBIC enables time-course expression profiling of whole adult brains with single-cell resolution. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Thomas2014,
abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) is widely used for mapping the structural connections of the human brain. Its accuracy is known to be limited by technical factors affecting in vivo data acquisition, such as noise, artifacts, and data undersampling resulting from scan time constraints. It generally is assumed that improvements in data quality and implementation of sophisticated tractography methods will lead to increasingly accurate maps of human anatomical connections. However, assessing the anatomical accuracy of DWI tractography is difficult because of the lack of independent knowledge of the true anatomical connections in humans. Here we investigate the future prospects of DWI-based connectional imaging by applying advanced tractography methods to an ex vivo DWI dataset of the macaque brain. The results of different tractography methods were compared with maps of known axonal projections from previous tracer studies in the macaque. Despite the exceptional quality of the DWI data, none of the methods demonstrated high anatomical accuracy. The methods that showed the highest sensitivity showed the lowest specificity, and vice versa. Additionally, anatomical accuracy was highly dependent upon parameters of the tractography algorithm, with different optimal values for mapping different pathways. These results suggest that there is an inherent limitation in determining long-range anatomical projections based on voxelaveraged estimates of local fiber orientation obtained from DWI data that is unlikely to be overcome by improvements in data acquisition and analysis alone.},

abstract = {CLARITY is a method for chemical transformation of intact biological tissues into a hydrogel-tissue hybrid, which becomes amenable to interrogation with light and macromolecular labels while retaining fine structure and native biological molecules. This emerging accessibility of information from large intact samples has created both new opportunities and new challenges. Here we describe protocols spanning multiple dimensions of the CLARITY workflow, ranging from simple, reliable and efficient lipid removal without electrophoretic instrumentation (passive CLARITY) to optimized objectives and integration with light-sheet optics (CLARITY-optimized light-sheet microscopy (COLM)) for accelerating data collection from clarified samples by several orders of magnitude while maintaining or increasing quality and resolution. The entire protocol takes from 7-28 d to complete for an adult mouse brain, including hydrogel embedding, full lipid removal, whole-brain antibody staining (which, if needed, accounts for 7-10 of the days), and whole-brain high-resolution imaging; timing within this window depends on the choice of lipid removal options, on the size of the tissue, and on the number and type of immunostaining rounds performed. This protocol has been successfully applied to the study of adult mouse, adult zebrafish and adult human brains, and it may find many other applications in the structural and molecular analysis of large assembled biological systems.},

This viewpoint reflects its origins in a time when the use of single-neuron anatomical and physiological techniques was prominent. However, newer multineuronal recording methods have revealed that ensembles of neurons, rather than individual cells, can form physiological units and generate emergent functional properties and states. As a new paradigm for neuroscience, neural network models have the potential to incorporate knowledge acquired with single-neuron approaches to help us understand how emergent functional states generate behaviour, cognition and mental disease.},
