# Introduction {.unnumbered}

## Multiscale intrinsic complexity of the brain {.unnumbered}

Brain = Complex system with components over multiple length scales.
This complexity is intrinsic as opposed to incidental...

## Trends in biological models used in neuroscience {.unnumbered}

Trend towards more larger, more complex brain models in neuroscience--presumably
to model more complex phenotypes

## Evolution of experimental techniques {.unnumbered}

Techniques optimized for simpler systems, hard to apply to directly to these new
models

Technological breakthroughs in neuroscience are often those advances that allow
researchers to attack long-standing biological questions in new ways.

CLARITY, optogenetics, organoid culture - all examples of this for different
reasons

## Thesis aims {.unnumbered}

This work is aimed at addressing technical challenges associated with scaling up
the staining and imaging or large brain models, the computational analysis of
whole-brain scale datasets, and the culture of organoid brain models.
